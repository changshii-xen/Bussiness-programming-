Advantages:
Users are actively involved in the development

Since in this methodology a working model of the system is provided, the users get a better understanding of the system being developed.

Errors can be detected much earlier.

Quicker user feedback is available leading to better solutions.

Missing functionality can be identified easily

Disadvantages:
Leads to implementing and then repairing way of building systems.

Practically, this methodology may increase the complexity of the system as scope of the system may expand beyond original plans.

Incomplete application may cause application not to be used as the
full system was designed
Incomplete or inadequate problem analysis.
